--  File: chickenize.dtx by Arno Trautmann, mail: arno dot trautmann at gmx dot de
This is the README file that should contain some important information. So far I can only tell you to run the file chickenize.dtx to produce the three files
  chickenize.pdf  (documentation)
  chickenize.tex  (low-level commands; plainTeX)
  chickenize.sty  (LaTeX user interface)
  chickenize.lua  (Lua package code)

You need an up-to-date TeX Live (2011, if possible) to use this package.

For any comments or suggestions, contact me:

Hope you have fun with this!
