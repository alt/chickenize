This is the README file of the chickenize package. The package provides several commands and lua functions to manipulate the input or output tokens of any Lua(La)TeX document. It is /not/ intended for serious documents!

To produce the package files, run lualatex on chickinize.dtx, wich should result in the creaction of the following files:
  chickenize.pdf  (documentation)
  chickenize.tex  (plainTeX user interface)
  chickenize.sty  (LaTeX user interface) [may vanish]
  chickenize.lua  (Lua package code) [does the actual work]

You need an up-to-date TeX Live (2011, if possible) to use this package.

Hope you have fun with this package!
