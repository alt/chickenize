This is the README file of the chickenize package. The package provides several commands and Lua functions to manipulate the input or output tokens of any Lua(La)TeX document. It serves mostly educational and playful usage, but some functions may be used in serious documents.

To produce the package files, run lualatex on chickinize.dtx, wich should result in the creation of the following files:
  chickenize.pdf  (documentation)
  chickenize.tex  (plainTeX user interface)
  chickenize.sty  (LaTeX user interface)
  chickenize.lua  (Lua package code) [does the actual work]

You need an up-to-date TeX Live (2011 or 2012, if possible) to use this package. Maybe a full MiKTeX will do, too.

For any comments or suggestions, contact me:

Hope you have fun with this package!
