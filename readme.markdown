This is the README file that should contain some important information. So far I can only tell you to run the lualatex on the file chickenize.dtx to produce the four files
  chickenize.pdf  (documentation)
  chickenize.tex  (low-level commands; plainTeX)
  chickenize.sty  (LaTeX user interface)
  chickenize.lua  (Lua package code)

You need an up-to-date TeX Live (2011, if possible) to use this package.

For any comments or suggestions, contact me:

Hope you have fun with this!
